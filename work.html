      <div><h3>ALA 320/321</h3>
        <p>"The Program on Intergroup Relations (IGR) is a social justice education program. IGR blends theory and experiential learning to facilitate students' learning about social group identity, social inequality, and intergroup relations. The program prepares students to live and work in a diverse world and educates them in making choices that advance equity, justice, and peace." (From the IGR website.)
        <br><br>ALA 320 is the IGR peer-facilitator training program, and ALA 321 is the facilitator Practicum. I was a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for 4 semesters of ALA 321 and 1 semester of ALA 320. The slides below are from a class session with activities my faculty co-instructor and I specifically created for that semester's group of facilitators.</p></div>

      <div><h3>Spectrum Center Allyhood Development Training</h3>
        <p>The Spectrum Centerâ€™s Allyhood Development Training (ADT) is a six-hour long training session.
        As part of my work as the Education & Training Program Manager in 2018, I updated and revised the ADT for increased engagement and to better reflect the Spectrum Center's mission and 5-year Strategic Plan.
        I utilized the ADDIE model to guide my revisions and assessments indicated that the updated training was more effective and engaging for participants. I also created a report documenting the revision process with notes for future iterations, as well as an in-depth facilitator's guide.

      <div><h3><br>IGR Google Drive Training</h3>
        <p>I designed a digital organizational system for The Program on Intergroup Relations (IGR) on Google Drive, including a document file naming protocol, then facilitated a 2-part training on both the new system and how to effectively use Google Drive for the entire department, along with a department-specific instruction manual. Below are some slides from Part 1 of the training. </p></div>

      <div><h3>Clinton-Macomb Public Library Subject Headings Project</h3>
        <p>Part of my work as a librarian at the Clinton-Macomb Public Library includes working on our Subject Headings Update Project. Subject Headings are an essential part of cataloging, and significantly impact the findability of materials and patron catalog search experience. The report below was submitted to the Director of the Library for review with our recommendations for first-round subject heading updates. </p></div>

      <div><h3>Michigan Publishing Accesibility Review</h3>
        <p>My team and I conducted an accessibility review of the Michigan Publishing wesbite for a class project in SI 539: Design of Complex Websites.
          We used the POUR framework from the WCAG 2.1 AA standard to group the issues we found. We listed cases for which these situations affect accessibility.
          Below are slides from our presentation; the project also included an in-depth report submitted to Michigan Publishing.
